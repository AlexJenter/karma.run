## Introduction

karma.run ("karma" for short) is an integrated back-end server solution to power data-driven
client applications. It is designed to be easy to use directly from a web browser, IoT or mobile environment.

## Features

karma.run comes with batteries included and features such as:
 * nested data object models.
 * strong serializable consistency.
 * powerful ABAC-based access control.
 * a relational model with traversable reference graph.
 * functional, homoiconic query interface.

## Roadmap

There are many features and tasks yet to be implemented. Some of them are:
 * Write lots of unit tests and measure code coverage.
 * Releasing a karma.run-compatible web-based GUI ("the web editor") as FOSS.
 * Writing and releasing official client libraries for different programming languages.
